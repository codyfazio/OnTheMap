# OnTheMap

This is a required project for completion of Udacity's iOS Nanodegree. 

The user logs in with their Udacity credentials and is presented with the locations of other Udacity students in the form of pins on a map or in a table view. In the map view, the user can tap on a pin to view an annotation containing location  infomation. Upon taping the annotation, the user is redirected to Safari to view a url posted by the student. In the table view, the user is presented with a list of students that have posted their location. Upon tapping the student's name, they are redirected to Safari to view the url the student has included in their post. The user can also share their own location and a url of their choosing. 

Login is made possible through GET requests with the Udacity API. Location information and shared URLs are accessed through the Parse API.
